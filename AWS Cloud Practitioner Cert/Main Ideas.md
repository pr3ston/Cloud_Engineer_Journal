- Fault Tolerance
	- Fault Domains - Used to prevent 1 failure from spreading to another Area (Server rack, AZ, Region, etc)
	- Fault Level - Collection of Fault Domains
- AWS Global Network
	- Used to describe the AWS private network backbone
- Point of Presence (POP)
	- The immediate area between the End User and the AWS region
	- Owned by AWS or trusted partner
	- Edge Locations - DCs that have a cache of the most popular files
	- Regional Edge Locations - have larger 
- Tier 1
	- A network that can access the internet without any needed steps
- AWS POP
	- Services that use POP
		- Cloudfront - Pushes files to be cached at edge locations
		- S3 Transfer Accelerator - Generates special URL used to upload files faster over AWS network
		- Global Accelerator - Allows faster traffic to services using AWS network
- AWS Direct
	- A direct connection that connects DCs, offices, co-location and AWS
	- Uses Direct Locations
	- Low latency, high bandwidth, lower network costs
	- Not encrypted
- Direct Locations
	- A DC from AWS or trusted party that connects you to AWS
- Local Zones
	- DCs in a dense populated area to provide low latency to highly demanding applications
	- Think Hollywood with media
	- limited services
- Wavelength Zones
	- Using cellular connections to host VMs
- Data Residency
	- Where Data resides

## Pricing Key Concepts
- Pay as you go
- Save when you commit
	- Committing to certain time may grant discounts
- Pay less by using more
	- Some services, pricing tiered -> More you use, less you pay

## Driving Factors of Cost
#### Compute
- Pay by certain span of time
	- By the hour, minute, etc
#### Storage
- Depends on how much storage you provisioned/are using
- Tiered pricing for some storage
	- Optimize on how frequently and quickly you access data
- S3
	- Storage pricing
	- Request and retrieval
	- Data transfer and transfer acceleration
	- Data managements/analytics
	- Replication
	- Processing data
#### Data Transfer
- No charge for inbound data transfer or data transfer between AWS services in the same region (Most cases)
- Outbound data transfer is aggregated across services, then charged at the outbound rate
	- More data you transfer, less you pay per GB
